This simple web app lets you load a YouTube video and view its subtitles in sync with playback. The transcript is fetched from YouTube's timedtext API when available and highlighted word by word as the video plays.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Paste a YouTube link in the input box and click **Load Video**.

If English subtitles exist for the video, they will appear below the player and scroll automatically.
